# Frontend software engineer challenge

## Challenge instructions

For this exercise, you're going to implement a web page according to the design https://xd.adobe.com/view/58a63b0c-dadf-467f-4701-2358299734b6-2e97/. The purpose of the page is to allow users to see policies relevant to them in a table, showing them the current status of each policy.

### User journey

- The user should be able to search for a policy (or policy fragment) in the search field, and the table should update with the results.

- The filter by status dropdown can be used to further filter the results by status.

- The stats section should display the data for stats

- The upcoming events should display the data for upcoming events

### API

We have created a fake API using json-server. Documentation can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server

### Responsive design

There is a mobile design and a desktop design but nothing in between. Please implement a solution that you think works best. You can ignore the order of the columns which change in mobile view
